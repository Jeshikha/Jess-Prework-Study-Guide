# Jess Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide has been created by me in July 2023 for the bootcamp that I have signed up for with the University of Birmingham to understand Web development. It comprises important highlights on HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. I have learnt how to use VS Code and have installed relevant apps that was required for me to submit my prework before the start of the bootcamp.

## Usage

This Prework Study Guide is to be used to facilitate my understanding on relevant topics I have learnt during my prework studies such as HTML, CSS, GitHub and JavaScript. If you open DevTools, you can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics I learned from prework and choose one topic for me to study first.
